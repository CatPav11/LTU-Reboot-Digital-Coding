    I also learned about different web concepts. For example the difference between the web and the internet, and the relationship between server and the client. 
    In the last lesson of week 1 I began to learn about HTML tags. For example using heading, paragraph and body tags. 
    I also learned how to use the Go live function on visual studio code, which allows you to view the webpage you are working on in a live browser. 
    We also learned some more about Git such as version control, branches and commit. </p>

    On the last day of the week it was good to put some of what we have learned into practice. For example, using HTML tags on our reflections and then viewing the page on the browser.
    It was also good to becoe more familiar with the text editor and Graphic User Interface, and with pushing saved contend from the desktop to the browser </p>
